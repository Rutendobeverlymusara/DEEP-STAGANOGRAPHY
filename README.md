# DEEP-STAGANOGRAPHY

This project aims to embark on a journey and unravel the layers whilst pushing the 
boundaries of digital image steganography by integrating deep learning into existing methods, tools, and techniques. Breaking 
through these boundaries will result in more secure, robust, and adaptable hiding strategies that can explore the frontiers of 
emerging technologies whilst withstanding the challenges in the digital world. 


The study has the following objectives and deliverables: 


• Objective 1:- Integration of Deep Learning Models to Existing Steganographic Techniques or 
Systems: 

Deep learning integration enhances steganography by automating embedding and extraction strategies, adapting to 
cover data patterns, and improving security against steganalysis.  

Deliverables: Carefully design and train Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) and learning the existing 
steganography techniques 


• Objective 2:- Leveraging feature engineering to enhance imperceptibility: 

To avoid detection through visual or statistical analysis, it is important for deep learning models to be trained and 
learn relevant features and patterns to cover and hide information more subtly while ensuring an increase in the 
capability of steganographic systems to embed information without noticeable alterations to the host. 

Deliverables: To preprocess the data efficiently and use data transformative tools 


• Objective 3:- Increase resilience against detection: 

The main goal with this objective is to maintain effectiveness of the deep learning strategies overtime and stay ahead 
of the emerging detection techniques such as steganalysis 

Deliverables: Testing the trained model and images on detection tools  


• Objective 4:- Enable real-world adaptability. 

This objective is to make sure that the adaptability of Steganography tools are effective  and applied in real-world 
scenarios by training models to adapt to different images  

Deliverables: Use Adaptable steganography methods 

• Objective 5:- Increase of  secure communication 

The goal is to improve advance security with the embedded media and offer better and secure communication 
between the sender and the receiver of the cover object.  

Deliverables: Using encryption keys for communication
